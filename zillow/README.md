#Zillow API PHP Library


This PHP library is to ease the use of Zillow API. As of today (October 10, 2012), this API supports all API functions of Zillow, including
* GetSearchResults
* GetZestimate
* GetChart
* GetComps
* GetDemographics
* GetRegionChildren
* GetRegionChart
* GetRateSummary
* GetMonthlyPayments
* GetDeepSearchResults
* GetDeepComps
* GetUpdatedPropertyDetails

## How to use

You must have your Zillow API key to use this library. You could get one at Zillow.com easily.

$zillow_api = new Zillow_Api($zws_id); // $zws_id is your Zillow API Key  
$search_result = $zillow_api->GetSearchResults(array('address' => '7356 CARTER AVE', 'citystatezip' => 
'NEWARK'));  


Because the library autosaves the "zpid" in the object if the function returns one. You could do something like this on one same property without have to worry about the zpid.

$property = $zillow_api->GetSearchResults(array('address' => '7356 CARTER AVE', 'citystatezip' => 'NEWARK'));  
$estimate = $zillow_api->GetZestimate();  
$chart = $zillow_api->GetChart(array('unit-type' => 'dollar'));  
$comps = $zillow_api->GetComps(array('count' => '10', 'rentzestimate' => true));  

Because the "zpid" is autosaved after the GetSearchResults function was called, you don't have to pass the "zpid" in the subsequent functions calling.



That's all. Happy Hacking!
